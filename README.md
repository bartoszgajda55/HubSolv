# HubSolv

## Running application
Got to the backend directory and run
```
php -S localhost:8000 -t public
```

## Importing DB
There is a dump of Database used for this application (hubsolv.sql). Import it into your DB (I used MySQL)

## Configuration
If you need to adjust the config of the project, go to backend/.env file and edit required properties. Most likely that will be DB connection settings.
